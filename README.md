## C
### Example of a bad design
Flint garage elevator:

### The issue
It is not intuitive when I was trying to find thrid floor button. In this interface, thrid level button is on the right of the second floor button, which is not pratical. There is enough space for 4 buttons. It's easy to make a straight layout.

## B
### Common use
-press floor button
-press close door button
-press open door button

However, the above elevator design has a problem when finding the floor button, since first floor are on the same level with second floor, which is not correct in real life.

### elevator feedback
Besides close and open door button, pressing a floor button will turn its light on so that user knows the elevator is working corretly.

### common mistake
If I were going to second floor, I might press the thrid floor button by mistake because I would think the button above first floor is second floor, which is not in this design.
