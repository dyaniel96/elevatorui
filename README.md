### Example
Flint garage elevator:

### Issues
It is not intuitive when I was trying to find the second floor button. In this interface, the third floor button is on the right of the first floor button, which is not practical. There is enough space for 4 buttons. It's easy to make a straight layout.

## B
### Common Use
-press floor button
-press close door button
-press open door button

However, the above elevator design has a problem when finding the floor button, because the first floor is on the same level with the second floor, which is not correct in real life.

### Elevator Feedback
Besides close and open door button, pressing a floor button will turn its light on so that user knows the elevator is working correctly.

### Common Mistake
If I were going to the second floor, I might press the thrid floor button by mistake because I would think the button above the first floor is the second floor, which is not in this design.

### Improvements for UX(User Experience)
First thing I will do is to re-organize the layout so that the buttons are intuitive to find. Besides, I will also add more features to show extra information on the control panel such as weather condition and elevator capacity.

Size: 3 ft x 2 ft

There are 5 buttons for each floor. Close and Open buttons on the bottom. An emergency button on the bottom right.<br/>
More information on the top panel which tells the date, weather, capacity, and current floor.<br/>
There is a speaker which will announce the current floor and the direction it is going.<br/>
